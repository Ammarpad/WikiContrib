Intro
=====

**WikiContrib** is a tool that is developed to help the scholarship committee reviewers
who need developer contribution statistics while reviewing applications for Wikimedia events to get
the contributions of the developer from two different platforms

1. Gerrit
2. Phabricator

and visualize the data in form of graphs and user contribution activity. Apart from scholarship
committee reviewers, the tool can also be used by all others to view the contributions of
the user to the Wikimedia Foundation.


**Note:** The tool is called **Contraband** during development. After the initial development phase, the tool is renamed to **WikiContrib**.
